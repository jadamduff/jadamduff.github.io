<p>I'm a former Life Insurance professional from beautiful Nashville, TN.  A few years ago I set out to build a tech platform to change the way Life Insurance agents run their business.  In the process, I spent two years learning web/software development and fell in love with it. Now I'm a student @ Flatiron School, polishing my skills with the goal of joining a company as a Software Engineer.</p>
