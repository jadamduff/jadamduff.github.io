Let me give you a coding problem.  You have a set of javascript objects that you've designed to work together through inheritance to manipulate data and display it to the DOM.  You've spent an hour or so wiring it up and testing it as you go, but when you finally include the final piece, it all breaks.  You have a complex web of objects and functions working together and somewhere in all of it is a dreaded bug that has rendered your work useless.

This is a situation that your average coder faces regularly.  One second it was all working as expected, your confidence in your programming abilities was at an all time high, and poof... with one click of the refresh button, you're staring at a block of code as if you've never coded a day in your life.

So what do you do?

Some will panic, some will get angry, and some will cry.  But no matter your first steps, anyone serious about fixing their code will eventually get to work identifying the problem.  You might try to isolate the bug by undoing your work in reverse chronological order until you get back to a place where your code worked. You might start writing tests for all of your functions or throwing debuggers and console logs into every dark corner of your application. Then, with enough patience, persistence, and some amount of luck, you'll get to the root of the problem.

This process is a hampster wheel in a way. Fixing one bug obviously doesn't prevent other bugs from working their way into your code.  And in some cases, fixing one bug could cause another.  But as you do this over and over, you'll eventually become proficient in debugging.  Eventually that initial bit of panic is replaced by self confidence and determiniation.  That's how we mature.

Doesn't that sound a lot like how we mature as human beings too?  When things hit the fan in some life arena, immaturity comes with a lack of debugging experience.  A teenager who gets dumped is significantly more devastated than the mid-thirties version of themselves. Why? Because they didn't have the skills to debug the problem.  That teenager will spend significantly more time in the sad/angry/confused phase than someone who has been through this multiple times and has the confidence to identify the problem and learn for the future.

So why do coders make good therapists? Because they've been through the ringer in their own code and have plenty of practice in debugging hard problems.
