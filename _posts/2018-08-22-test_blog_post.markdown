I've recently finished working on my CLI Data Gem project for Flatiron School, a project to build a Ruby Gem using Nokogiri and OpenURI to scrape data from a web page and display it using a CLI.  Additionally, our CLI was to have at least one nested menu where a user could request and receive additional data.

You can check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jadamduff/sb_bracketeer).

## Superbowl Bracketeer

My first order of business in designing my Gem was to choose what kind of data I'd want to provide my user. On top of that, it would have to be a type of data that was rich enough for me to provide a <i>second layer</i> of data -- data about data.

Quickly I realized that I could entirely limit the design of my Gem by choosing the wrong data type to scrape.
